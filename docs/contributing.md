!!! tip
    * Find us on our [Slack channel](https://cfb-public.slack.com) #water.
    * Join our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/qP7oYyWn/safe-water).

We are using [python](http://python.org) with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
although some people are using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as well.

## Github repository

Fork and clone our github repository at [codeforboston/safe-water](http://github.com/codeforboston/safe-water).
When  writing code, create a new branch, and push it to your own fork.
Then, create a pull request and ask on the channel for people to review it.
We usually merge branches on tuesdays at the Hack Night.

All code goes into the `code/` subdirectory, into the language-specific directories.

All documentation is written in [mkdocs markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org) 
using the [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
theme. Contribute to it by expanding and writing new files in the `docs/` 
directory.

### Python notebooks

All notebooks currently go into `code/python/notebooks`.
Try to use local links inside the repository to refer to data,
and try to give easy instructions to reproduce your steps.
