# Data Format

## SDWIS data schema

The [SDWIS Model](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model) gives very minimal information
about the actual data schema.

## SDWIS List of Action Codes

[SDWIS -- List Validations by Element](/files/ListValidationsByElement.pdf)
gives a rundown of action codes found in the database.

## Contaminant codes

Contaminant codes can be found in various locations on the internet and
have been compiled into 2 CSV files located in the `data/` directory.
