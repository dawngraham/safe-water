For most toxic chemicals or mixture of chemicals (e.g., xylene mixed isomers), the TRI_CHEM_ID is the Chemical Abstract Service Registry (CAS) number.  A given listed toxic chemical or mixture may be known by many names but it will have only one CAS number.  For example, methyl ethyl ketone and 2-butanone are synonyms for the same toxic chemical and thus have only one C\nAS number (78-93-3).  For categories of chemicals for which CAS Registry numbers have not been assigned, a four-character category code, asssigned by TRI, is included in TRI_CHEM_ID.   Form R section 1.1 will be empty if a trade secret was claimed for the toxic chemical and information is provided in Section 1.3 or 2.1.",
