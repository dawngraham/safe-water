A value of '0' (zero) means no adjustment was made.\n  \n    In reporting years 1987 through 2005, the TRI program collected Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes on submissions to\n     identify the primary business lines of reporting facilities.  In reporting year 2006, TRI switched to the North American \n     Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.  To facilitate the comparison of TRI data across these two time periods, \n     NAICS codes were assigned to submissions in reporting years 1987-2005.  \n  \n    In some cases the assignment of a NAICS code to a submission had to be adjusted to fit the NAICS codes that were valid for a \n    particular reporting year.   This column indicates when that happened.\n      \nThe U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce maintains the list of NAICS codes.  Every five years, starting in 1997, the Census \nBureau updates and releases a new list.  Normally, an updated list will contain some individual codes that have been retired and replaced \nby several other codes that offer more detail into a business line/industry.   For example, on the 2007 list, the code \"221119\" was defined \nas \"Other Electric Power Generation\".  On the 2012 list, \"221119\" was retired and replaced with these five NAICS codes that offered more detail:  \n  \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221114 - Solar Electric Power Generation \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221115 - Wind Electric Power Generation \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221116 - Geothermal Electric Power Generation \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221117 - Biomass Electric Power Generation \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221118 - Other Electric Power Generation\n      \nLikewise, several codes could be retired and replaced by a single NAICS code.  For example, \"311222 - Soybean Processing\" and \"311223 - Other Oilseed Processing\" \nboth appeared on the 2007 list.   They were retired and replaced by the single NAICS code of \"311224 - Soybean and Other Oilseed Processing\" on the 2012 list.",
