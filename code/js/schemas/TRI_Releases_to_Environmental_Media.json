The reporting of REACH codes enables EPA and other researchers to accurately map discharges to the correct stream when conducting analysis.  \n  \nEPA maps all reported discharges to REACHes (REACH codes) for purposes of its Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model, Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMR) Pollutant Loading Tool, and for other analyses. Identifying a REACH code ensures that EPA will map discharges to the correct stream or water body. In TRI-MEweb (TRI’s reporting software), facilities have the option of using an interactive map to locate and identify the receiving stream or water body to which the chemical was released. TRI-MEweb will automatically populate the appropriate REACH code when a facility selects the receiving water body on the map. \n  \nNote that REACH data are not available for Alaska Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands, so facilities located in these areas will not report this data.",
