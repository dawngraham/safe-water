# Safe Water

This is a Code for Boston project that is trying to predict
health-based drinking water violations using the
Environmental Protection Agency's
[Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model).

We will explore other datasets from the EPA,
including the [Toxic Release Inventory database](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/tri-search),
the [Superfund Enterprise Management System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-search),
the [Environmental Radiation Monitoring database](https://www.epa.gov/radnet),
and the [Enforcement and Compliance History Outline](https://echo.epa.gov/). 

We are using Python for the analysis and are in the early stages.
